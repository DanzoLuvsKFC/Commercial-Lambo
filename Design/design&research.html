            <p class="TitleFlex">
              Here are my wireframes for my website. I have maintained this design as I noticed it was common among car
              websites. The reason I chose this design version was due to its popularity among car websites. However,
              since the assignment also focuses on creativity and design principles, I will express my individuality
              through the execution of certain images, graphics, and color palettes.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              The data visualization page includes two visualizations. The first is a notebook that demonstrates using
              d3.interpolateZoom to implement smooth pan-and-zoom transitions between two views, which will be images of
              the cars from the front. Each circle represents a car as an item. Additionally, I have included a bar
              graph feature where the x-values are not shown, but the y-values serve as name tags for the bars. In my
              case, the image of the bar will be replaced with a side view of the vehicle.
            </p>

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              Moreover, both visuals will have an extra feature: when the user's cursor hovers over an item or the image
              of the car in both visuals, a pop-up will display more information about the car, such as pricing,
              gasoline intake, and model number.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              The page design is quite simple, utilizing two large graphics to fill the negative space within the page.
              The respective information can be accessed through a large, labeled button. The information will also be
              color-coded to maintain a consistent aesthetic throughout the webpage. Additionally, the information will
              be centered and will not touch the borders of the page to avoid making the user feel cramped.
