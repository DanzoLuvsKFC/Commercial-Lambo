            <h3>The User</h3>
            <p>
                When understanding our users/audience, there are certain questions that we must keep in mind: who our audience is and what type of information they are looking for.

                The purpose of my website is to showcase different Lamborghini models to potential customers. However, the site does not function as a marketplace but rather as a platform that shares information on the said models.

        <section id="Product">
            <h3>The Product</h3>
            <p>
                The product, which is the website, serves as an official Wikipedia-like site that provides information on Lamborghinis and displays data in an engaging and interactive way.

            <h3>Key Principles</h3>
            <p>
                I recall how the great Andre once pointed out that when users open a website, they can almost instantaneously tell whether that website is the kind of experience they're looking for. In a matter of seconds, they'll form an impression of the design, layout, and overall feel. If it doesn't resonate with that initial feeling of relevance or appeal, users will quickly move on in hopes of finding a more suitable option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because my website has a highly specific purpose, it needs to exude aesthetics and professionalism right from the start. The visual design should not only capture attention but also clearly and effectively convey the intended message. A well-executed, professional look can instill trust in users and encourage them to explore further, while a lack of polish or attention to detail can drive them away, regardless of the content's value. Therefore, forming a solid, coherent first impression is crucial for retaining users on the site.
