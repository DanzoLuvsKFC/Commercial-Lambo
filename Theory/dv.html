            <h1>Data Visualization</h1>
            <p>The website's luxury brand theme requires maintaining high standards of quality and professionalism.
                Luxury brands prioritize clear and concise information, reflecting their reputation for excellence.
                Similarly, the website aims to provide users with a refined experience matching the quality associated
                with the brand’s vehicles.</p>

            <h2>API Usage</h2>
            <p>Exploring APIs has been insightful, revealing their role as repositories of valuable data that users can
                access as needed. Initially, I perceived APIs as modifiable data sources, but I have since understood
                that they provide structured data access rather than modification. This clarified the value placed on
                certain paid APIs, given the utility and appeal of some data sets.</p>

            <h2>Data Visualization Techniques</h2>
            <p>The project incorporates two main data visualizations. One uses a bar graph, where each bar is
                represented by a side view image of the car model. The second utilizes D3.js’s interpolateZoom feature
                to create smooth transitions, providing a dynamic pan-and-zoom effect for enhanced user interaction.</p>

            <p>The first visualization displays front view images of car models within circular, interactive frames.
                When a circle is clicked, it zooms in to focus on the model, while a hover reveals a popup with car
                specifications. This immersive interaction engages users while delivering key information effectively.
            </p>

            <p>The second visualization, initially intended as a bar graph of car names on the y-axis and car images on
                the x-axis, now displays car prices. Hovering over a bar reveals the car’s image, adding a playful
                element by allowing users to associate each bar’s length with the car type, creating a guessing
                game-like experience.</p>
