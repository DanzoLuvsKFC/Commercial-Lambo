        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>Since the website is based off of a luxury brand, there are certain aspects that must be maintained, such as
            quality and professionalism. The luxury brand does not come with vague ideas and information but rather with
            clear and concise ideas as the brand itself is quite reputable, and hence the same care and quality that is
            provided with their cars must also be provided with the website.</p>

        <h2>API Usage</h2>
        <p>When it came down to the API, I decided to delve myself into more research. So I decided to learn more about
            APIs; although the idea and concept is still a bit vague to me, I believe I have the premise or the idea of
            it. The way I see APIs are like digital books, as they essentially store data and keep it there for people
            to use. However, at first, I thought that the data that APIs store or are able to be manipulated, but I came
            to realize that they are not. Now I also understand why some APIs are to be paid for and things of that
            matter. It also shows me that certain data is quite valuable to have or rather some of them are more
            appealing to the eye.</p>

        <h2>Data Visualization Usage</h2>
        <p>As the assignment requires, I have made use of two data visualizations. One is essentially a bar graph in
            which I change the images of the bar to that of a side view image of the specific car model, and the other
            is one that makes use of, and I quote because I am unsure of how to put it into my own words: “This notebook
            demonstrates using d3.interpolateZoom to implement smooth pan-and-zoom transitions between two views. See
            also d3.zoom’s transitions, which also allows freeform zooming.”</p>

        <p>With the first data visualization, which is the latter listed above, I aim to use front view images of the
            car model and structure them within a circle. The circles are interactable as they zoom into themselves and
            make themselves the priority of viewing when clicked on, and when hovered over, there is a little pop-up of
            information that displays itself. The information displayed are just specifications of the car.</p>

        <p>With the second data visualization, the information makes use of a bar graph format, where the car names are
            shown on the y-axis and the images of the cars are shown on the x-axis. This was the plan at first, but I
            have then decided to use the bar graphs to show the price of the cars instead. This visual also makes use of
            the pop-up information feature in the previous visual, but instead, this time it will show the image of the
            car instead. I really like this feature instead because it sort of gives the user a little game where they
            would see the length of the bar, and once they hover over it to see the car type, it sort of feeds them some
            sort of reward, like a little guessing game.</p>
