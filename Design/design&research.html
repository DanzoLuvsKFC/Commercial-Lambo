            <p class="TitleFlex">
              Here are my wireframes for my website. I have maintained this design as I noticed it was common among car
              websites. The reason I chose this design version was due to its popularity among car websites. However,
              since the assignment also focuses on creativity and design principles, I will express my individuality
              through the execution of certain images, graphics, and color palettes.

            <h2 class="Quote13">DATA VISUALS PAGE</h2>

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              The data visualization page includes two visualizations. The first is a notebook that demonstrates using
              d3.interpolateZoom to implement smooth pan-and-zoom transitions between two views, which will be images of
              the cars from the front. Each circle represents a car as an item. Additionally, I have included a bar
              graph feature where the x-values are not shown, but the y-values serve as name tags for the bars. In my
              case, the image of the bar will be replaced with a side view of the vehicle.
            </p>

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              Moreover, both visuals will have an extra feature: when the user's cursor hovers over an item or the image
              of the car in both visuals, a pop-up will display more information about the car, such as pricing,
              gasoline intake, and model number.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              The page design is quite simple, utilizing two large graphics to fill the negative space within the page.
              The respective information can be accessed through a large, labeled button. The information will also be
              color-coded to maintain a consistent aesthetic throughout the webpage. Additionally, the information will
              be centered and will not touch the borders of the page to avoid making the user feel cramped.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              After recieving feed back from both of guys I felt the need to up my page styling a lot more. I was
              funnily enough heavily inspired by the Ferrari and Bugatti websites. I especially liked the way they both
              used their graphics whether it be throught videos or even the way they have place their images. The
              simplisitc nature of the design was so well executed for me that I decided to try and replicate that but
              still put my own twist into in. Below are the final figma designs I developed for this website.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              The premise for the content pages is the same, a lot more simplistic and designed in a way to not overwhelm the user but rather to make the focus more on the content itself.
