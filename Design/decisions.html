        <h2>The User</h2>
        <p>When understanding our users/audience, there are certain questions that we must keep in mind: who our
            audience is and what type of information they are looking for.</p>
        <p>The purpose of my website is to showcase different Lamborghini models to potential customers and so forth.
            However, the site does not function as a marketplace but rather as a site that shares information on the
            said models.</p>

    <section id="Product">
        <h2>The Product</h2>
        <p>The product, which is the website, is sort of like an official Wikipedia site that provides information on
            Lamborghinis and displays data in a cool and interactive way.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Key Principles">
        <h2>Key Principles</h2>
        <p>I recall how the great Andre once pointed out that when users open a website, they can almost instantaneously
            tell whether that website is the kind of experience they're looking for. In a matter of a few seconds,
            they'll have an impression of what that design is, what the layout is, and what the overall feel is. If it
            doesn't pop with that initial feeling of relevance or appeal, users will be quick to shut it and move along
            in hopes of finding a more relevant fit for their needs.</p>
        <p>Because my website has a highly specific purpose, it needs to exude aesthetic and professionalism right out
            in front. The visual design should not only serve to capture attention but also clearly and effectively
            inform the intended message. A well-executed, professional look can make users trust it and want to stay and
            navigate within, while a lack of polish or attention to detail can make them want to push away, no matter
            how valuable the content. Therefore, forming a solid, coherent first impression is important in making users
            stick with the site.</p>
