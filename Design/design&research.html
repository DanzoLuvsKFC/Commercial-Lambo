            <p class="TitleFlex">
              Here are my wireframes for my website. I have maintained this design as I noticed it was common among car
              websites. The reason I chose this design version was due to its popularity among car websites. However,
              since the assignment also focuses on creativity and design principles, I will express my individuality
              through the execution of certain images, graphics, and color palettes.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              The data visualization page includes two visualizations. The first is a notebook that demonstrates using
              d3.interpolateZoom to implement smooth pan-and-zoom transitions between two views, which will be images of
              the cars from the front. Each circle represents a car as an item. Additionally, I have included a bar
              graph feature where the x-values are not shown, but the y-values serve as name tags for the bars. In my
              case, the image of the bar will be replaced with a side view of the vehicle.
            </p>

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              Moreover, both visuals will have an extra feature: when the user's cursor hovers over an item or the image
              of the car in both visuals, a pop-up will display more information about the car, such as pricing,
              gasoline intake, and model number.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              The page design is quite simple, utilizing two large graphics to fill the negative space within the page.
              The respective information can be accessed through a large, labeled button. The information will also be
              color-coded to maintain a consistent aesthetic throughout the webpage. Additionally, the information will
              be centered and will not touch the borders of the page to avoid making the user feel cramped.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              After recieving feed back from both of guys I felt the need to up my page styling a lot more. I was
              funnily enough heavily inspired by the Ferrari and Bugatti websites. I especially liked the way they both
              used their graphics whether it be throught videos or even the way they have place their images. The
              simplisitc nature of the design was so well executed for me that I decided to try and replicate that but
              still put my own twist into in. Below are the final figma designs I developed for this website.

            <p class="TitleFlex">
              The premise for the content pages is the same, a lot more simplistic and designed in a way to not
              overwhelm the user but rather to make the focus more on the content itself.

          <h2 class="Quote13">BRIEF CONTEXT</h2>
          <p class="TitleFlex">
            Lamborghini is a luxury brand known for developing some of the most popular and expensive supercars in the
            world. It is often seen as a symbol of wealth. Accordingly, the aesthetics and feel I aim to execute are
            those of luxury, quality, and professionalism.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Typography">
          <h2 class="Quote13">TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
          <p class="TitleFlex">
            As mentioned earlier, the effect I am aiming for is that of luxury, making the choice of font quite
            important to convey a fancy vibe. However, after some deliberation, I realized that Lamborghini is not just
            about being fancy; it is about reliability and quality. Therefore, the font must be strong and affirm this
            ideology.
          </p>
          <p class="TitleFlex">
            This conclusion was drawn from the official Lamborghini website, where the font choice conveys strength and
            quality rather than fanciness. The fonts I have chosen for the site are Pangchan and Satoshi. Apart from the
            website, I have applied design principles and decided to go with these two fonts for dynamicism.
          </p>

          <h2 class="Quote13">COLOUR PALETTE</h2>
          <p class="TitleFlex">
            For the website's color palette, the first colors that came to mind were a dark grey and the goldish-yellow
            seen in the Lamborghini badge. These are the primary colors I wanted to use. Additionally, I opted for white
            text to effectively convey information.

            The main graphics I will use are images of various Lamborghini models, as the primary purpose of my website
            is to sell or display these cars.

              <h2 class="Quote13">USER EXPERIENCE GOALS</h2>
              <p class="TitleFlex">
                  My primary goal for this site’s user experience is to create an interface that is both visually appealing and intuitive. Given Lamborghini’s luxury brand, it’s essential that the site feels premium yet simple to navigate, allowing users to focus on the cars and not be distracted by overly complex design.

              <h2 class="Quote13">INTERACTION DESIGN</h2>
              <p class="TitleFlex">
                  To enhance user interaction, I plan to include subtle animations, such as smooth transitions and hover effects. These will not only make the site feel more dynamic but will also guide the user’s attention to key areas, creating a seamless browsing experience that aligns with the brand’s sophisticated image.
              </p>

          <section id="ResponsiveDesign">
              <h2 class="Quote13">RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h2>
              <p class="TitleFlex">
                  Ensuring that the website is fully responsive is crucial. The design will adapt to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This adaptability will reflect Lamborghini’s commitment to quality and performance in all conditions.
              </p>
          </section>
          
          <section id="Accessibility">
              <h2 class="Quote13">ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
              <p class="TitleFlex">
                  Accessibility is another important aspect of the site. I will follow WCAG guidelines to ensure that users with disabilities can navigate the site effectively. This includes proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, and meaningful alt text for images, which aligns with Lamborghini’s value of inclusivity.
