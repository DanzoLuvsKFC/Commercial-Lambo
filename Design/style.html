            <h2>Brief Context</h2>
            <p>
                Lamborghini is a luxury brand known for developing some of the most popular and expensive supercars in the world. It is often seen as a symbol of wealth. Accordingly, the aesthetics and feel I aim to execute are those of luxury, quality, and professionalism.

            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, the effect I am aiming for is that of luxury, making the choice of font quite important to convey a fancy vibe. However, after some deliberation, I realized that Lamborghini is not just about being fancy; it is about reliability and quality. Therefore, the font must be strong and affirm this ideology.
            </p>
            <p>
                This conclusion was drawn from the official Lamborghini website, where the font choice conveys strength and quality rather than fanciness. The font I have chosen for the site is Pangchan.

        <section id="Colour Palette">
            <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
            <p>
                For the website's color palette, the first colors that came to mind were a dark grey and the goldish-yellow seen in the Lamborghini badge. These are the primary colors I wanted to use. Additionally, I opted for white text to effectively convey information.

        <section id="Graphics">
            <h2>Graphics</h2>
            <p>
                The main graphics I will use are images of various Lamborghini models, as the primary purpose of my website is to sell or display these cars.
