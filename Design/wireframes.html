                Here are my wireframes for my website. I have maintained this design as I noticed it was common among car websites. The reason I chose this design version was due to its popularity among car websites. However, since the assignment also focuses on creativity and design principles, I will express my individuality through the execution of certain images, graphics, and color palettes.

            <h3>Data Visuals Page</h3>
            <img src="../Images/Bar Graph.png" class="Content-Image" alt="Bar Graph Wireframe">

                The data visualization page includes two visualizations. The first is a notebook that demonstrates using d3.interpolateZoom to implement smooth pan-and-zoom transitions between two views, which will be images of the cars from the front. Each circle represents a car as an item. Additionally, I have included a bar graph feature where the x-values are not shown, but the y-values serve as name tags for the bars. In my case, the image of the bar will be replaced with a side view of the vehicle.

            <p>
                Moreover, both visuals will have an extra feature: when the user's cursor hovers over an item or the image of the car in both visuals, a pop-up will display more information about the car, such as pricing, gasoline intake, and model number.

                The page design is quite simple, utilizing two large graphics to fill the negative space within the page. The respective information can be accessed through a large, labeled button. The information will also be color-coded to maintain a consistent aesthetic throughout the webpage. Additionally, the information will be centered and will not touch the borders of the page to avoid making the user feel cramped.
