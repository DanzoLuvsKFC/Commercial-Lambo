        <p>"Well done is better than well said." - Benjamin Franklin.</p>

            <p>The above quote is something I read awhile ago, and is something I have kept with me ever since. Whenever
            dealing with a task, I always try to do it the best I can and I like to do a lot of tasks, as you can see by
            the many names and titles I have receieved in doing so.</p>

            <p>But yeah, thats a little bit of background information about me. My name is Mark Daniel Lasco. I am
            currently and 3rd-year student in Digital Arts, majoring in Game Design and Interactive Media.</p>
