    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <section>
        <h2>Brief Context</h2>
        <p>Lamborghini is a luxury brand, they develop one of the most popular as well as the most expensive supercars
            in the world. It is often seen as an object of wealth once in possession. So accordingly, the aesthetics and
            the feel that I will try to execute is that of luxury, quality, and professionalism.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Typography">
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>As I said within the previous statement, the effect that I am aiming for is that of luxury, so the choice in
            font is quite important as it must give off a sort of fancy vibe. That was what I thought at first, however,
            over some time and deliberation, I thought to myself, I do not think that Lamborghini is meant to instill
            the idea that they are a luxury or fancy brand, but rather to show that they are a reliable and
            quality-focused producing company.</p>
        <p>So their font must be strong and affirm that very same ideology. I came to this conclusion because of the
            official website for Lamborghini. The font choice within that site does not give off fancy but rather that
            of strength and quality. So the font choice I have chosen for the site is Pangchan.</p>

    <section id="Colour Palette">
        <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
        <p>When it came to the colour palette for the website, the first colours that came into my mind were this sort
            of dark grey and that goldish yellow that is seen within the Lamborghini badge. Those are the colours I
            wanted to make use of within the website. The only other colour I used was for the text where I make use of
            white to show information effectively.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Graphics">
        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p>The main graphics that I make use of are just images of various models of Lamborghini, as obviously the faux
            purpose of my website is to sell or display various models of the cars.</p>
